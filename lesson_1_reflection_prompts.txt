How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    All the changing that have been done are marked

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can understand the step to the solution

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros : nore controll
    cons : easy to mistake

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    changes are interconnected

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log print all the commit information
    git diff display the difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you are able to be in the preceding state

    To be able to refactor your code  is a great idea


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
